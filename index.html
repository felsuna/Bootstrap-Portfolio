                        <p>
                            Hello! I was born and raised right here in Tucson, AZ where everything
                            wants to poke or sting you. I really love
                            animals, plants, and nature so I decided to attend the University of Arizona and received a
                            bachelor's
                            degree
                            in
                            natural resources with a focus on wildlife management and
                            conservation (wordy I know).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Aside from that passion, I love video games and the technology industry. Which
                            brings me here, as to why I am
                            attending
                            the
                            program! I still have that strong "itch" to see if I could make a career path into it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What's this? Still reading? Okay! I have a precious black cat with
                            yellow golden eyes,
                            her name is Okami (yes, named after the video game), and she loves to play
                            fetch..."yaaaaas". My
                            favorite anime
                            film director is Hayao Miazaki/Studio Ghibli. No one can beat me at Mariokart 64. I built
                            my own PC,
                            there is
                            just so much satisfaction doing it yourself! I enjoy painting and baking treats. I have a
                            bracelet that
                            is
                            permanently stuck on my wrist since elementary school. That is all.
