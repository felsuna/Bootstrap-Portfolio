                <p>Hello! I was born and raised right here in Tucson, AZ where everything wants to poke or
                    sting you. I really love animals, plants, and nature so I decided to attend the
                    University
                    of Arizona and received a bachelor's degree in natural resources with a focus on
                    wildlife
                    management and conservation (wordy I know).</p>
                <p>Aside from that passion, I love video games and the technology industry. Which brings me
                    here, as to why I am attending the program! I still have that strong "itch" to see if I
                    could make a career path into it.</p>
                <p>What's this? Still reading? Okay! I have a precious black cat with yellow golden eyes,
                    her
                    name is Okami (yes, named after the video game), and she loves to play
                    fetch..."yaaaaas".
                    My favorite anime film director is Hayao Miazaki/Studio Ghibli. No one can beat me at
                    Mariokart 64. I built my own PC, there is just so much satisfaction doing it yourself!
                    I
                    enjoy painting and baking treats. I have a bracelet that is permanently stuck on my
                    wrist
                    since elementary school. That is all.</p>

<!--I couldn't figure out how to line up my name and links in the navbar with the content. -->
<!-- Content alignment is off when changing px sizes too...tried me best! -->
<!-- Links don't work when I got to smaller px sizes(?)-->
