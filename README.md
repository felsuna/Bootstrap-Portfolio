# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio!

Here you can learn a little bit about me and see the projects I've made and worked on throughout journey course of the UA Coding Bootcamp program.

I have learned to work with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, JSON, Node.js, and more to come as I continue on my journey!
